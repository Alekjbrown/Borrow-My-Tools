When lending out a tool to a friend you should br able to know who has it, for how long, and other relevant information to replacement of the tool. However, currently when someone borrows a tool it can be hard to remember who has borrowed what and when. This leads to confusion and loss of tools. Financially, replacing tools can become quite costly when you dont know your inventory or where it currently is. On average a technician keeps around $50,000* of tools around, when they are missing and have to be replaced often this number can double or triple over a few years.
Using a system to keep inventory of your tools as well as who may have borrowed them and how much they cost? can help you plan to grt your property back or plan to repurchase on a reasonable basis. The kindness of lending a tool to a friend can come back later to cost you, keeping an inventory and information on borrowers can help eliminate expenses related to replacement tools.
